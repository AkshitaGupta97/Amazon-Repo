            Sunsets occur due to the Earth’s rotation, marking the transition
            from day to night. However, their enchanting hues stem from a scientific
            process called scattering. As the sun descends, light travels a longer path
            through the atmosphere, scattering short-wavelength light, blue and green, 
            to the sides and leaving us with the longer-wavelength, warm hues of red, orange,
            and pink.
